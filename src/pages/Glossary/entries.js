When the conscious mind intends to perform some action a group of relevant schemas are activated. Activated schema stand ready, waiting for specific triggers or cues from the environment in order to actually execute the schema. Errors result from unintentional activation of inappropriate schemas, loss of activation through interruption or forgotten intention, or faulty triggering of active schemas -- either false triggering by a similar cue, or failure to trigger. The more highly active a schema is, the easier it is to trigger it with similar cues Interruptions and interference by the conscious mind also play a major role in faulty triggering."
