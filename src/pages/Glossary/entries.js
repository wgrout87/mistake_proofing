Action-based detection is an immediate detection of the error based on a perception that the action was different than what was intended, or planned. This detection mechanisms does not rely on cues from the environment, but is rather an internal function."

                definition: "actions which are commonly performed over time will become established as unconscious routines called schemas (or schemata, both are plural of schema). When the conscious mind intends to perform some action a group of relevant schemas are activated. Activated schema stand ready, waiting for specific triggers or cues from the environment in order to actually execute the schema. Errors result from unintentional activation of inappropriate schemas, loss of activation through interruption or forgotten intention, or faulty triggering of active schemas -- either false triggering by a similar cue, or failure to trigger. The more highly active a schema is, the easier it is to trigger it with similar cues Interruptions and interference by the conscious mind also play a major role in faulty triggering."

The detection and stoppage can be effected by either a worker or a machine. Detection schemes include contact, altogether, and action step methods. Mistake-proofing as a quality control technique is a subset of autonomation. Autonomation can also be employed for other, non-quality, purposes."
